    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by learning the normal pattern of data and identifying instances that do not fit the pattern. Since anomaly data (outliers) is rare, it’s difficult to label enough data for supervised learning. Instead, models like clustering or autoencoders can identify deviations from the norm.\n",
